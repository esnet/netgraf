# defaults file for perfsonar-psconfig-publisher
#
# A curl command can be used to download a skeleton mesh file for local
# customization and publication.
#
# curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perfsonar/psconfig/master/doc/skeleton.json > files/my_mesh.json
#
# In order to publish a mesh, give it an entry in the
# perfsonar_psconfig_publish_meshes list.  The subelements
# are as follows:
#
# mesh: required.  filename of mesh copied to the remote_dir.  if remote_url
#   is not set, this filename is looked for in the Ansible "files" directory
#   in the Playbook or Role.
#
# remote_url: defaults to ''.  if this is set, get the mesh file to copy to
#   the remote_dir from the URL, not a local "files" directory.
#
# remote_dir: defaults to /tmp.  directory on target machine for mesh file.
#
# remote_agents: defaults to [].  a list of Ansible managed machines.
#   Ansible will try to use psconfig on each host to add the published
#   mesh's URL.  You can add Ansible host groups.
#
# remote_configure_archives: default to False.  Set to True if you want the
#   remote_agents to send results to archivers defined in the json mesh file.
#
